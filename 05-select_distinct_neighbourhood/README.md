Use the `DISTINCT` clause to help you produce a list of the
distinct neighbourhoods in the `airbnb_ny.stay` table. Please notice
the "u" in the table name.
(Don't add an `ORDER BY` clause to your query).

Your results should look something like this (these might not be correct results)
```
    neighbourhood
---------------------------
 Financial District
 Murray Hill
 Prospect Heights
 Ridgewood
