How could we know the minimum price that was paid in Brooklyn (neighbourhood_group)?
Write a query that gets the minimum value of the `price` column
of the `airbnb_ny.stay` table, when the `neighbourhood_group` column is "Brooklyn".

Your results should look something like this (these might not be correct results)
```
 min_price_brooklyn
 --------------------
                 35
