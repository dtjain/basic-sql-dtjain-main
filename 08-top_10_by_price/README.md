Add a `LIMIT` clause to your query from the previous
question in order to show just the 10 most expensive
stays in the database.

Your results should look something like this (these might not be correct results)
```
  id   | price
-------+-------
 19601 |   800
 60164 |   500
 61224 |   500
 23686 |   500
 38663 |   475
 27659 |   400
 15396 |   375
 26933 |   350
 45910 |   350
 26969 |   325
(10 rows)
```
