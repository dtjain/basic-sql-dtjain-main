Imagine in a meeting your co-workers at AirBnB get in an
argument about how expensive stays are in NYC. Help them
resolve the dispute by producing a list of stays in
descending order by price. Select just the `id` and the
`price` columns. You'll need to use the `ORDER BY` expression
and the `DESC` keyword.


Your results should look something like this (these might not be correct results)
```
  id   | price
-------+-------
 19601 |   800
 61224 |   500
 60164 |   500
 23686 |   500
 38663 |   475
 (...)
```
