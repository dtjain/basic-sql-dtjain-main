Imagine that you need to get a table with all the host names, the price they charged, and the
type of room rented. Write a query that selects `host_name`, `price` and `room_type` columns
and all rows of the `airbnb_ny.stay` table.
(Don't add an `ORDER BY` clause to your query).

Your results should look something like this (these might not be correct results)
```
host_name       | price |    room_type
----------------+-------+-----------------
John            |   149 | Private room
(...)
```
